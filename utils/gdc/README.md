Scripts here are for experimenting with GDC API queries.

Some are publicly hosted on https://proteinpaint.stjude.org/GDC/, to share with our UChicago colleagues for trouble-shooting and maintain transparency.

To host a script, do 

```bash
scp <script> prp1:/opt/app/pp/active/public/GDC/
```

Then, edit `/opt/app/pp/active/public/GDC/index.html` to list the new script.
