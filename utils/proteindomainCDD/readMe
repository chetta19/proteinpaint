#1. protein_manuallyCurated:
	manually curated protein domain. some of them already included in Homo_sapiens_CDD.Json, while some of them need to be combined with Homo_sapiens_CDD.Json to generate final protein db.

#2. NM_006060_proteindomain 
	protein domains from Mullighan

#3. protein_manuallyCurated.json
	manually curated domain
	NM_00620 All domain from NCBI for this transcript should be removed. Only manually curated domain would be added for this transcript.

#4. generate proteindomain.db
	generate proteindomain.db by simply running NCBI_CDD.sh under this folder 

#5. support human, zebrafish and mouse
