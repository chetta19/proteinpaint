#1. protein_manuallyCurated:
	manually curated protein domain. some of them already included in Homo_sapiens_CDD.Json, while some of them need to be combined with Homo_sapiens_CDD.Json to generate final protein db.

#2. NM_006206_proteindomain
	protein domains from this file should be present in the final protein db. All domain from NCBI for this gene should be removed before adding this data.

#3. protein_manuallyCurated.json
