#1. protein_manuallyCurated:
	manually curated protein domain. some of them already included in Homo_sapiens_CDD.Json, while some of them need to be combined with Homo_sapiens_CDD.Json to generate final protein db.

#2. NM_006060_proteindomain 
	protein domains from Mullighan

#3. protein_manuallyCurated.json
	manually curated domain
	NM_00620 All domain from NCBI for this transcript should be removed. Only manually curated domain would be added for this transcript.

#4. generate proteindomain.db
	generate proteindomain.db by simply running NCBI_CDD.sh under this folder 

#5. Domain tables for Ensembl genes are not provided. There are two ways to get the tables:
	ensembl_CDD_<species>.gz, ensembl_Pfam_<species>.gz, ensembl_smart_<species>.gz and ensembl_tigrfam_<species>.gz
	Domain tables should include 4 columns: transcript stable ID, gene name, domain ID, domain start and domain end.
	1. manually download them from http://useast.ensembl.org/biomart/martview/0b33cafdaebd19673cc93f70f64b6ccd
	2. run ensembl_download.py to download domain tables. python package 'pybiomart' is required. 

#6. support human, zebrafish and mouse
