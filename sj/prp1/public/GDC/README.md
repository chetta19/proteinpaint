# GDC Public Page

This folder collects all details about our GDC work. The content here are published at https://proteinpaint.stjude.org/GDC/.

- API usage and example node.js scripts
- example views (ssm, bam, termdb)

Everything should be publicly sharable, and makes it easy to share things with our Leidos/UC colleagues.

## Deploy

From the proteinpaint root folder,

```bash
scp -r sj/prp1/public/GDC/* prp1:/opt/app/pp/active/public/GDC
```
