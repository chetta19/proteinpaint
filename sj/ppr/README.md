# Internal Research Prod (PPR)

The Proteinpaint internal research production (pp-irp) host serves https://ppr.stjude.org. It is
mostly referred to as ppr (proteinpaint research). This machine has a network mount at /opt/data/gb
to an hpc directory, where SJ researchers can save their files to make it immediately viewable
using Proteinpaint, using a file or study argument to runproteinpaint.

The server topography is described in
[PeCan & ProteinPaint Servers and VMs](https://wiki.stjude.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=35528744).

The application setup within each host is described in
[Proteinpaint App Setup in SJ Hosts](https://wiki.stjude.org/display/compbio/Proteinpaint+App+Setup+in+SJ+Hosts).
