# Clinical Test (PP-ICT)

The Proteinpaint internal clinical test (pp-ict) host serves https://pp-ict.stjude.org. This machine
is meant as a staging server to support the ClinGen portal for logged in users. Like pp-ict, the deployments
to this machine are very infrequent, perhaps once a year. It also does not host public html pages,
just the proteinpaint bundles.

The server topography is described in
[PeCan & ProteinPaint Servers and VMs](https://wiki.stjude.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=35528744).

The application setup within each host is described in
[Proteinpaint App Setup in SJ Hosts](https://wiki.stjude.org/display/compbio/Proteinpaint+App+Setup+in+SJ+Hosts).
