# Public Research Test (PP-PRT)

The Proteinpaint public research test (pp-prt) host serves https://pp-test.stjude.org.
It is actually not viewable by the public, it is mostly used to test deployment
scripts and demonstrate certain features to more fully simulate the prp1, and that are
hard to test in a local development setup. For example, this is a good place to preview
features that are meant to be released to the public, but are not meant to be shown in
ppr.

The server topography is described in
[PeCan & ProteinPaint Servers and VMs](https://wiki.stjude.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=35528744).

The application setup within each host is described in
